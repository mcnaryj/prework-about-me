      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Just lookin' to get my code on.</p>
      <h1>Where are you from?</h1>
      <p>I'm from Broomfield, Colorado, and I've spent most of my adult life in Boulder.</p>
      <h1>What are your hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love playing music, skiing, taking care of animals, hiking, reading and learning, and I love doing most of these things with my girlfriend, Joy. I grew up skiing at Winter Park, and have branched out into the backcountry, which has been fun to change things up. I'm grateful to be able to play with a wide range of musicians, and have some exciting projects to look forward to. I've done a bit of traveling with my girlfriend, and we're both hoping to get over to Europe soon, should things not take a turn for the worse.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>College professor/freelance-translator/environmental activist/musician. No need to have just one!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Boulder, Colorado</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To have an idea of what I'm talking about and interacting within my day-to-day at a translation tech company, as well as in a broader sense.</p>
